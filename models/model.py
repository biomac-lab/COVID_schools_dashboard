    The simulation is Markov chain, whose state is recorded by three device
    arrays, state, state_timer, and states_cumulative. The ith entry of state
    indicates the state of individual i. The ith entry of state_timer indicates
    the time number of timesteps that individual i will remain in its current
    state, with 0 indicating that it will remain in the current state
    indefinietely. The (i,j)th entry of states_cumulative is an indicator for
    whether individual i has ever been in state j.

    Args:
      w: There are two otpions for w. 1) A DeviceArray of shape [n, n], where n
        is the population size. The entry ij represents the probability that
        individual i infects j. 2) A list of DeviceArrays [rows, cols, ps], where
        the ith entries are the probability ps[i] that individual rows[i] infects
        individual cols[i].
          total_steps: The total number of updates to the Markov chain. Else can be
        a tuple (max_steps, break_fn), where break_fn is a function returning
        a bool indicating whether the simulation should terminate.
      state_length_sampler: A function taking a PRNGKey that returns a
        DeviceArray of shape [n]. Each entry is an iid sample from the distibution
        specifying the amount of time that the individual remains infected.
      infection_probabilities: A DeviceArray of shape [7], where each entry is
        the probability of an infection given that an interaction occurs. Note
        that the 0, 1, 5, and 6 entries must be 0.
      recovery_probabilities: A DeviceArray of shape [7], where each entry is
        the probability of recovering from that state. Note that the 0, 1, 5, and
        6 entries must be 0.
      init_state: A DeviceArray of shape [n] containing ints for the initial state
        of the simulation.
      init_state_timer: A DeviceArray of shape [n] containing ints for the number
        of time steps an individual will remain in the current state. When the int
        is 0, the state persists indefinitely.
      key: An int to use as the PRNGKey.
      epoch_len: The number of steps that are JIT'ed in the computation. After
        each epoch the current state of the Markov chain is logged.
      states_cumulative: A DeviceArray of Bools of shape [n, 7] indicating whether
        an individual has ever been in a state.

    Returns:
      A tuple (key, state, state_timer, states_cumulative, history), where state,
      state_timer, and states_cumulative are the final state of the simulation and
      history is the number of each type over the course of the simulation.
